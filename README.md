# Zodiac TLS/SSL

Zodiac is an open-source, cross-smalltalk implementation of regular and secure socket streams. 
The primary goal of the project is to offer TLS/SSL streams that can then be used to implement 
for example HTTPS when combined with a suitable client such as Zinc HTTP Components.

This project lives under, is loaded by and is managed via the [Zinc HTTP Components](https://github.com/svenvc/zinc) project.

## For documentation there is the [TLS/SSL](https://github.com/svenvc/zodiac/blob/master/zodiac-paper.md) paper
